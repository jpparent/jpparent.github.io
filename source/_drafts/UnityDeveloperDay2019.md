Last Saturday was my first time attending a Unity Developer Day, and it was right here in Montreal. Without further ado, here's a briefing of my day.

## Getting There

Arriving at the John Molson School of Business pavilion of Concordia University, the steps were simple: register, grab a shirt, grab a coffee then wait for the opening keynote to start. Meanwhile, I spotted a couple of familiar faces, as is usually the case in these kind of events, and briefly did some catching up before the official start of the Developer Day.

## Opening Keynote

The keynote, given by Carl was straight to the point with a brief review of the past, present and future of Unity. Speaking of which, he then proceeded with a raytracing automotive live demo, running on his laptop right there (which alegedly had a RTX 2080 though). 

Then followed  with info on the different courses to be offered at Concordia's Online Courses in partnership with KnowledgeOne and Ubisoft : 

- L'Atelier XR: a workshop driven course on XR technologies
- Game Creator's Odyssey: a university level online course about game design offered in two acts: Rational Game Design and Rational Level Design. As a Game Design enthusiast, I was already aware and particularly interested in this one.
- Rabbids Coding!: A ~~free-to-play~~ totally free educational game that teaches kids basic programming logic. I personally like seeing these initiatives! The more people who code, the better :)
