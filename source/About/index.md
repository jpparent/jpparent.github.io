# About Me

Hello World! My name's Jean-Philippe (JP is shorter) and I'm a junior software engineering from Montreal, Canada. I mostly write about game development and related technologies.

Welcome to my (quite) simple website, built with â™¥ on [Hexo](https://hexo.io), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [open sourced](https://github.com/jpparent/jpparent.github.io) on GitHub! The site's theme is [Dark Cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/cactus-dark).
